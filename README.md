# Cytomine Community Edition 

Cytomine Community Edition is the open source edition of the Cytomine software.

This repo provide the new way to install Cytomine Community Edition, based on Docker compose.

**DISCLAIMER :** the version of Cytomine installed using this procedure is still in development, and is made available only for testing purpose. Do NOT use for production, nor to migrate data from an older version of Cytomine.

## How to launch a Cytomine local instance

This installation procedure is for Debian based Linux operating systems. 

You must have installed [Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and git, and have `root` permissions (sudo in Debian/Ubuntu).

1. Clone the repository on your computer/server: `git clone https://github.com/cytomine/Cytomine-community-edition.git`
2. Go into the cloned folder: `cd Cytomine-community-edition`
3. Edit the file `cytomine.yml` if you want to change default values (like URLs and/or SMTP setup)
4. Launch the installer. This will create all the folders and files necessary to launch Cytomine: `sudo docker run -v $(pwd):/install --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" --rm -it cytomine/installer:latest deploy -s /install`
5. Launch cytomine: `sudo docker compose up -d`. As a side effect, this last command will write in your local `/etc/hosts` file.

If you have kept the default values your Cytomine is now available on http://cytomine.local

The password of the `admin` account is available in the cytomine.yml file : `cat cytomine.yml | grep ADMIN_PASSWORD:`

To learn how to use Cytomine please refer to the [user guide in our documentation](https://doc.cytomine.org/user-guide/).

Note : All Cytomine data is stored in docker volumes (Postgres, Mongo, images and download buffers).
